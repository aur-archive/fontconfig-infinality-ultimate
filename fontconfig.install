  CAUTION: Manual action required
  -------------------------------

  A new Infinality runtime file has been installed as

  || /etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh.pacnew

  Please, replace manually any other instance of this file with the
  new one.

  Further information
  -------------------

  In order to avoid conflicts, most generic fontconfig files, as found
  in /etc/fonts/conf.d, should be removed and replaced by their 
  equivalents from fontconfig-infinality-ultimate package.
  
  The minimal working configuration should consist of the following files:

  || /etc/fonts/conf.d/49-sansserif.conf
  || /etc/fonts/conf.d/50-user.conf
  || /etc/fonts/conf.d/51-local.conf
  || /etc/fonts/conf.d/52-infinality.conf

  If you have installed TeX Live from Arch Linux [extra] repository,
  you will need

  /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive-fonts.conf

  in order to access TrueType and OpenType fonts shipped with TeX Live.
  Similarly, you should *not* remove any file created and/or needed by
  applications you are using. For example, this is the case with KDE
  which by default creates

  || /etc/fonts/conf.d/00kde.conf

  In most cases such additional config files provide access to fonts 
  installed in non-standard locations and don't affect freetype2 
  rendering settings.

  Font specific .conf files installed as a part of font packages (i.e.
  ttf-dejavu, ttf-liberation, ttf-droid, etc.) must be disabled as
  fontconfig-infinality-ultimate should already provide support for most
  typefaces available in Arch repositories.

  || Please, back up your /etc/fonts directory now and commit all 
  || required changes manually as described above.

post_remove() {
  cat << _EOF

  Check for dead symlinks and leftover files 
  in /etc/fonts/conf.d/.
  You should also remove /etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh
  or replace it with the original runtime file from
  freetype2-infinality package.
